IoT Device Security Scanner

IoT Device Security Scanner üîçüíª
Overview
The IoT Device Security Scanner is a powerful tool designed to scan your local network or specified IP address for open ports, and it alerts you when it detects risky ports commonly associated with vulnerabilities in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This tool helps you secure your network by identifying potential attack vectors such as Telnet and RDP ports, which are often exploited by hackers to gain unauthorized access to devices.

Whether you're securing your home network or conducting a security audit, this tool gives you peace of mind by ensuring that dangerous ports are detected and alerted in real-time.
